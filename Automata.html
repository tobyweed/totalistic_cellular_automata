            <h1> 1-Dimensional Totalistic Cellular Automata</h1>

            <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TotalisticCellularAutomaton.html">
            As described by Wolfram. </a>

            <p>Use by choosing a number of colors, a rule code, and hitting run.</p>
            <p>Try toggling random initialization, dragging the sliders from side to side,
                and zooming all the way out. You can also hit the arrow keys (when the slider
                is selected) to increment rule code by one).</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that you are likely
                witnessing automata that no one else has ever seen before!</p>
            <p>Also note that with any number of colors higher than 5, you cannot
                see all possible automata, as the number slider maxes out at 2147483647,
                a number much smaller than the number of possible rule codes for k > 6
                (given by k^(3k-2).</p>
