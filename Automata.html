    <h1> 1-Dimensional Totalistic Cellular Automata</h1>

    <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TotalisticCellularAutomaton.html">
    As described by Wolfram. </a>

    <p>Use by choosing a number of colors, a rule code, and hitting run.</p>
    <p>Try toggling random initialization, dragging the sliders from side to side,
        and zooming all the way out. You can also hit the arrow keys (when the slider
        is selected) to increment rule code by one).</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that (especially with higher numbers of colors) you are likely
        witnessing automata that no one else has ever seen before!</p>
